# DEPRECATED
This application will be replaced by a flutter app: https://github.com/redPanda-project/app

# ionic
Ionic android/iOS application 
(windows/linux app via electron possible)

This project was started recently from scratch and is currently under heavy development.
Do not use this app in the current stage, since there are still information which are shared unencrypted with other peers.

Here are some notes on the current development.

### What is working
* basic peer connection / rudimentary scoring of peers
* channel create
* channel maintaining via DHT in a basic form


### ToDo before any release is possible
* share of channels: QR code scan/show
* setup aes crypt 
* encrypt DHT information
